# TWFE Recent Literature
Data and code for TWFE/DID recent literature discussion, Columbia SDev Colloquium on November 5, 2021. 

--- 
This repository contains the following: 
- **Data**: Data from Stevenson and Wolfers (2006) and Cheng and Hoekstra (2013) to test different DiD methods.
- **Code**: Stata and R code to run TWFE and event-study for data, as well as _Bacon Decomposition_ and alternative TWFE methods: _Sun and Abraham (2021)_, _Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021)_, _Borusyak et al. (2021)_ and _Wooldridge (2021)_ (only in Stata). The Stata code is nicer (for now).
- **Literature**: Papers for new methods used in the code.
- **Output**: Folder for saving results.
- **Summary**: Very short summary of methods and datasets.
